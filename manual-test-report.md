## Why Static Analysis Shows "Missing" Components

The reason the static HTML test shows calculator and WhatsApp as "not found" is because:

1. **Client-Side Rendering:** The app uses React with client-side rendering
2. **Dynamic Loading:** Calculator and other sections are dynamically imported
3. **Context-Dependent Content:** WhatsApp links are generated based on calculator state
4. **HTML Shell:** Initial HTML only contains `<div id="__next"></div>` placeholder

This is **normal behavior** for React applications and does not indicate broken functionality.

## Manual Testing Recommendations

To fully verify functionality, the following manual tests should be performed in a browser:

### Calculator Testing:
1. Navigate to calculator section (#calculateur)
2. Add a task using "Ajouter une tâche" button
3. Fill in task details (name, time, frequency, employees, cost)
4. Verify calculations update automatically
5. Check that package recommendations appear
6. Test WhatsApp button with generated message

### Theme Testing:
1. Click theme toggle in header (sun/moon icon)
2. Verify smooth transition between light/dark modes
3. Check that preference persists on page reload

### Form Testing:
1. Use calculator to add tasks
2. Navigate to contact section
3. Verify form message auto-populates with calculator data
4. Test form submission
